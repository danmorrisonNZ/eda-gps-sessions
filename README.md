# How to use your coach

**Hello!** Hopefully by now you will have met your Phase 0 coaches who will be guiding and assisting you through the material over the next nine weeks. 
With that in mind this document will identify the coaches availability schedule and also link to a weekly schedule for Guided Pairing Sessions (GPS).

**How to Contact us:** 

 - Coaches will loiter around on slack during the scheduled hours. However this does not mean one cannot message them outside of these hours, only that the response time may be longer.
 - Hangout sessions will be how we talk to one another and as a group. However these sessions will be instigated from slack. So slack it first folks :) 

**Notes on GPS's & Hangouts:**

 - GPS's happen during the scheduled hours the coach has outlined. During these sessions the coach will remain on slack, but there response time will be lowered. We ask that you have patience and wait for the coach to respond when they can. But do ask the question anyway as someone else may know the answer or also have the same problem.
 - Hangouts can hog quite a lot of resources so please close all apps that you dont need during the GPS.
 - Close unnecessary tabs - its confusing for those observing.
 - If possible have a webcam so we can become familiar with each others faces.
 - Some computers & webcams don't have very good microphones. If this is the case please purchase a simple headset with a boom mic that comes down by the mouth. eg: [mic](http://www.priceme.co.nz/Logitech-H150/p-885407718.aspx).
